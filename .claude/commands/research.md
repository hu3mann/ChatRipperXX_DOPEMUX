Automatically query Context7 for authoritative library API docs and code examples, combined with Exa web research for community best practices and tutorials. Context7 provides official documentation while Exa handles broader web research. All findings are logged to ConPort with source attribution and synthesis of requirements/risks/unknowns.

Steps:
1. **Context7 Integration**: Auto-query Context7 for library APIs mentioned in the research query
2. **Exa Web Research**: Search for community patterns, tutorials, and best practices
3. **Synthesis**: Combine authoritative docs with community insights
4. **Risk Analysis**: Identify implementation risks and unknowns
5. **ConPort Logging**: Store all findings with source attribution
6. **Requirements Mapping**: Extract actionable requirements from research

Expected output: Comprehensive research report with authoritative API documentation, code examples, community patterns, risk assessment, and ConPort-stored findings.
