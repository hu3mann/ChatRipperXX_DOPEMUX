Compact current slice to switch tasks:
- State: 10â€“12 bullets (what's done, pending, blockers).
- Files touched + open TODOs with owners.
- Mem0: add_memories entries for decisions, caveats, follow-ups (tagged).
- Memory-bank: persist new patterns/snippets to /docs/patterns/**.
- Clear server-memory scratch for a fresh context.
