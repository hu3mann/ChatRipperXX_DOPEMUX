Post-run mini retro:
- What worked, what failed, time sinks, 3 improvements.
- Mem0: add as separate entries; repo docs (`docs/**`) + ConPort decision/progress: update /docs/runbooks/<topic>.md if a new pattern emerged.

> Token thrift:
- **ConPort**: prefer summaries/search with small `limit` (3â€“5) before full context.
