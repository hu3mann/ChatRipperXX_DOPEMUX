# Forensic Validation Command

**Validate forensic analysis workflow integrity and evidence chain preservation for ChatX**

## Purpose

Ensure ChatX forensic analysis workflows maintain proper evidence chains, source fidelity, and provenance tracking required for forensic chat analysis. This command validates that all data transformations preserve forensic integrity and maintain complete audit trails.

## Execution Steps

1. **Forensic Workflow Analysis**
   - Trace data flow from raw platform extraction through final analysis
   - Validate source metadata preservation at each transformation step
   - Check for forensic evidence chain completeness
   - Verify provenance tracking through entire pipeline

2. **Source Fidelity Validation**
   - Confirm canonical message schema preserves original platform data
   - Validate `source_ref` and `source_meta` field completeness
   - Check attachment metadata preservation (without binary content)
   - Verify timestamp accuracy and timezone handling

3. **Transformation Integrity Check**
   - Validate that message normalization preserves forensic value
   - Check conversation chunking maintains message relationships
   - Verify enrichment pipeline doesn't alter original data
   - Confirm vector indexing preserves source references

4. **Evidence Chain Documentation**
   - Generate comprehensive data lineage documentation
   - Map all transformation steps with input/output validation
   - Document confidence levels and quality metrics
   - Verify reversibility where forensically required

5. **Psychology Analysis Forensic Review**
   - Validate psychology analysis maintains source attribution
   - Check confidence scores and uncertainty quantification
   - Verify multiple analysis passes maintain consistency
   - Confirm local-first analysis for sensitive psychology labels

6. **Audit Trail Completeness**
   - Verify complete provenance metadata for all operations
   - Check deterministic operation reproducibility
   - Validate salt-based seeding for consistent results
   - Confirm operation timestamps and user attribution

## Forensic Integrity Checklist

### Data Preservation Requirements
```
✓ Original platform data preserved in source_meta
✓ Message timestamps maintain timezone information
✓ Conversation threading preserved through transformations  
✓ Attachment metadata retained (binary content excluded)
✓ User identifiers consistently pseudonymized
✓ Reaction and reply relationships maintained
```

### Transformation Validation
```
✓ All transformations are documented with rationale
✓ Confidence levels assigned to all derived information
✓ Source attribution preserved through analysis pipeline
✓ Multiple transformation paths yield consistent results
✓ Reversibility maintained where forensically required
✓ Privacy redaction doesn't compromise forensic value
```

### Provenance Tracking
```
✓ Complete audit trail for all data modifications
✓ Transformation step documentation with parameters
✓ User actions logged with timestamps and context
✓ System configuration preserved in provenance
✓ Reproducible operations with deterministic seeding
✓ Chain of custody documentation complete
```

## Forensic Quality Metrics

### Source Fidelity Score
- **Platform Coverage**: Percentage of original platform data preserved
- **Metadata Completeness**: Ratio of source_meta fields retained
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Precision of temporal information preservation
- **Relationship Integrity**: Conversation structure preservation rate

### Analysis Confidence Validation
- **Psychology Confidence**: Validate confidence gating (τ ≥ 0.7)
- **Enrichment Consistency**: Multi-pass analysis agreement rates
- **Local Analysis Preference**: Ratio of local vs cloud analysis decisions
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Proper uncertainty reporting for forensic use

### Evidence Chain Strength
- **Provenance Completeness**: Full audit trail coverage percentage
- **Reversibility Index**: Operations that can be undone for investigation
