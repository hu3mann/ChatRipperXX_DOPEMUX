Summarize the current task in ≤5 bullets.
Then:
1) Use claude-context: list hot files & TODOs likely impacted.
2) Use context7: fetch docs for mentioned libs/frameworks at the exact versions; quote the sections we’ll rely on.
3) Query openmemory (Mem0): “open decisions & caveats” for this project/slice.
4) Confirm constraints (lint/types/tests ≥60% coverage; RFC-7807; interface contracts).
5) Propose a tiny test-first plan (≤5 steps), no edits yet; await my “OK”.
