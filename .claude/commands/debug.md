Comprehensive debugging workflow with Context7 API documentation verification.

Steps:
1. **Reproduce Issue**: Confirm and document reproducible test case
2. **Isolate Problem**: Narrow down to specific component/library causing issue
3. **Context7 Verification**: Auto-query Context7 for official API behavior and documentation
4. **Cross-reference Implementation**: Compare code against Context7 authoritative examples
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify discrepancy between expected (Context7) and actual behavior
6. **Fix Implementation**: Apply corrections based on official documentation
7. **Guard Tests**: Add regression tests using Context7-informed patterns
8. **Validation**: Cross-check fix against Context7 API specifications
9. **ConPort Postmortem**: Log findings, fixes, and lessons learned

Expected output: Resolved issue with guard tests, verified against authoritative API documentation, and ConPort-stored postmortem analysis.
