# Optimized MCP Workflow Patterns

## Memory-First Development Pattern
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Query OpenMemory]
    B --> C{Relevant Context Found?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Load Context + Sequential Thinking]
    C -->|No| E[Create New Context]
    D --> F[Implement with Serena LSP]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Store Results in ConPort]
    G --> H[Update OpenMemory]
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Context Retrieval**: Query OpenMemory for existing patterns/projects
2. **Analysis**: Use Sequential Thinking for problem decomposition
3. **Research**: Query with Exa for best practices if needed
4. **Implementation**: Use Serena for code operations with LSP guidance
5. **Storage**: Store implementation patterns in ConPort
6. **Learning**: Update OpenMemory with successful patterns

**Token Efficiency**: ~40-50% reduction through context reuse and focused queries

## Research-Driven Implementation Pattern
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Complex Feature] --> B[Query Exa for Best Practices]
    B --> C[Extract Patterns with Sequential Thinking]
    C --> D[Store Research in OpenMemory]
    D --> E[Create Implementation Tasks]
    E --> F[Execute with Serena + ConPort Tracking]
    F --> G[Validate with Tests]
    G --> H{Results Valid?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Document in ConPort]
    H -->|No| J[Refine with Sequential Thinking]
    J --> F
```

**Key Integration Points:**
- **Exa Queries**: Limited to 5 results with semantic relevance
- **ConPort Storage**: All research findings with version control
- **OpenMemory**: Cross-session research pattern learning
- **Serena**: Implementation with automatic error correction

**Performance Metrics:**
- Research completion: <2 minutes
- Implementation accuracy: >90%
- Context reuse: >60%

## Multi-Model Validation Pattern
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Critical Decision] --> B[Initial Analysis with Opus]
    B --> C[Cross-validate with Gemini 2.5 Pro]
    C --> D[Consensus Analysis with Sequential Thinking]
    D --> E{Consensus Achieved?}
    E -->|No| F[Additional Analysis with Claude Sonnet]
    E -->|Yes| G[Store Decision in ConPort]
    F --> D
    G --> H[Execute with Serena Implementation]
    H --> I[Monitor Results with Dashboard]
```

**Validation Framework:**
1. **Primary Analysis**: Initial assessment with primary model
2. **Cross-Validation**: Alternative perspective from different model
3. **Consensus Building**: Sequential Thinking synthesis
4. **Implementation**: Serena execution with monitoring
5. **Results Tracking**: Automated validation and learning

**Quality Assurance:**
- Decision confidence scoring: >80%
- Implementation success rate: >95%
- Learning feedback loop: Continuous improvement

## Context Optimization Strategies

### Automatic Context Compaction
- **Trigger**: Context usage >80%
- **Method**: Remove redundant information, merge similar contexts
- **Retention**: Preserve task relationships and ConPort references
- **Recovery**: Restore from ConPort if needed

### Memory Warming Patterns
- **Startup**: Load frequently used contexts from OpenMemory
- **Predictive**: Pre-load likely needed resources based on patterns
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of stale memory entries

### Token Budget Management
- **Per-Session Limits**: 80% context threshold with automatic compaction
- **Tool-Specific Optimization**:
  - TaskMaster: status=pending + withSubtasks=false saves ~15k tokens
  - ConPort: limit=3-5 reduces token usage by ~10k
  - Zen: filesâ‰¤1 parameter saves ~25k tokens
  - Serena: Use symbolic tools before file reads
  - Exa: Refine queries to reduce from generic to specific

## Performance Monitoring Integration

### Real-time Metrics
- **Context Efficiency**: Track token usage vs. productivity
- **Tool Response Times**: Monitor MCP server performance
- **Memory Hit Rates**: Measure cache effectiveness
- **Error Recovery**: Track automatic fallback success rates

### Automated Optimization
- **Threshold Triggers**: Auto-compaction at 80% context usage
- **Pattern Learning**: Improve suggestions based on usage
- **Health Monitoring**: Detect and recover from degraded performance

## Workflow Integration Points

### Todo System Integration
- **Task Creation**: ConPort-backed with OpenMemory context
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatic status updates via Serena integration
- **Completion Validation**: Sequential Thinking verification
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Store successful patterns in OpenMemory

### Error Handling Patterns
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to cached data when servers unavailable
- **Automatic Retry**: Smart retry logic with exponential backoff
- **User Notification**: Clear feedback on system status and actions
- **Recovery Procedures**: Step-by-step recovery from failure states
