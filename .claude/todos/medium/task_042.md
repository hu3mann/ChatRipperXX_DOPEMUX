## Task: Document System Architecture and User Guides (Two-Track + Smart Static)
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: [41]

### Description
Produce detailed documentation for the Smart Static baseline and its tracks, now including a revised Track 3: constrained dynamic loading with pattern-based activation, synchronous execution, and strict safety controls. Emphasize Smart Static as the foundation (startup-only policy definition, deterministic configuration), while documenting the simplified, feasible Track 3 approach as an opt-in, policy-gated extension. Cover migration from prior dynamic approaches to the Smart Static baseline and the constrained dynamic model, troubleshooting, and usage.

### Implementation Details
Use MkDocs (v1.5+) for the documentation site. Provide architecture diagrams for Track 1 (Smart Hooks Evolution), Track 2 (Progressive Command Consolidation), and the revised Track 3 (Constrained Dynamic Loading). Present Smart Static configuration as the foundation across all tracks: policies and toggles are defined at startup and immutable thereafter. Clarify that dynamic server lifecycle management remains unsupported; Track 3 enables in-process, synchronous, policy-gated dynamic activation only. Include configuration examples, feature flag/toggle guides, and admin playbooks focused on deterministic startup behavior plus constrained, auditable dynamic actions. Canonical environment toggles for the static baseline remain: SMART_STATIC_CONFIG (replaces SMART_STATIC_LOADING), PREDICTIVE_SELECTION (replaces HOOKS_PREDICTIVE), and CONSOLIDATION. Introduce explicit Track 3 policy flags: DYNAMIC_CONSTRAINED_ENABLE (opt-in, default false), DYNAMIC_PATTERN_ALLOWLIST (comma-separated or YAML list of approved patterns/globs), DYNAMIC_PATTERN_DENYLIST, DYNAMIC_SYNC_ONLY=true (required; asynchronous/background execution prohibited), DYNAMIC_TIMEOUT_MS, DYNAMIC_RESOURCE_LIMITS (e.g., tokens/memory/calls), and DYNAMIC_SAFE_MODE=strict. Document snapshotting/versioning of static configurations and dynamic policy settings, including a manifest (version/hash/metadata, plus dynamic policy snapshot: enabled state, allow/deny patterns, limits). Provide step-by-step restoration procedures to known-good versions that reset policy state to disable or re-enable constrained dynamic loading as defined by the manifest. Provide a migration guide from prior dynamic approaches to the Smart Static baseline and the constrained Track 3 model, including deprecation notes and mappings from old dynamic flags to static and constrained-dynamic equivalents. Explain the rationale for revising Track 3 into a constrained, synchronous, safe mode and outline expected impact targets (55-65% overall improvement) while regaining selective runtime flexibility under strict controls. Ensure docs are updated with each release and include CI/link-check steps to prevent regressions or accidental reintroduction of unconstrained dynamic-loading or dynamic server management references.

### Test Strategy
Manual review of documentation completeness, clarity, and accuracy. Validate with user walkthroughs covering static setup, feature toggling at startup, consolidation workflows, rollback procedures using the versioned manifest, and constrained dynamic usage: pattern-based activation, synchronous execution, and safety policy enforcement. Perform link checks, MkDocs build verification, and runnable examples verification. Acceptance checks: no references claiming Track 3 is abandoned; no guidance enabling dynamic server lifecycle management; environment variable names and behaviors match the static baseline and constrained dynamic policy model; static examples produce deterministic configuration artifacts (including consistent manifest/hash) across runs with identical inputs; constrained dynamic examples are synchronous, respect allow/deny patterns and limits, generate audit logs, and fail closed with safe fallback to static behavior when policies are violated.
