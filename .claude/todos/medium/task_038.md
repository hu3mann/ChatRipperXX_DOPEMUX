## Task: Develop MetricsCollector for Hooks and Consolidation
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: [34], [35], [37]

### Description
Create a MetricsCollector to gather real-time metrics on token reduction, hook latency, command consolidation effectiveness, and resource usage.

### Implementation Details
Use Prometheus client (v0.17+) for metrics export. Track token reduction percentages, hook execution latencies, command consolidation rate (duplication reduction), error rates, and CPU/memory usage. Store aggregated summaries in local SQLite (v3.42+) for dashboard integration. Provide queries and reports aligned to impact targets: Track 1 (30-40% token reduction), Track 2 (25% duplication reduction), Smart Static Loading (10-15% configuration optimization), and 55-65% overall improvement.

### Test Strategy
Unit test metrics collection, export, and storage. Validate accuracy under load and during failure scenarios. Ensure metrics schemas are versioned and backward compatible. Cross-check recorded metrics against synthetic workloads for correctness.
