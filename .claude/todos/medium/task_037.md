## Task: Implement Config and Hooks Health Monitor
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: [34]

### Description
Develop a health monitor that checks configuration integrity, hook performance, and detects drift or degradation, triggering alerts or safe reverts.

### Implementation Details
Use psutil (v5.x) to monitor resource usage and ensure hooks remain lightweight. Periodically verify config checksums and schema validity. Detect abnormal hook latencies and error spikes; log health events for an audit trail. Integrate with the Predictive Hooks Engine to temporarily disable or downgrade costly heuristics when thresholds are breached. Provide structured outputs consumable by MetricsCollector.

### Test Strategy
Unit tests for config drift detection, latency threshold triggers, and audit logging. Simulate misconfigurations and resource pressure scenarios. Validate that safe-disable behavior activates and restores correctly.
