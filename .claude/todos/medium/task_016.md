## Task: Implement Advanced Differential Privacy Composition
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: None

### Description
Enhance privacy budget management by implementing advanced composition techniques for differential privacy queries.

### Implementation Details
Research and implement optimal composition strategies (e.g., Moments Accountant, Rényi Differential Privacy) in src/chatx/privacy/differential_privacy.py. Replace basic composition logic with a more accurate noise calibration method. Use libraries such as Google’s Differential Privacy library (python-dp) if compatible, or implement custom logic as needed.

### Test Strategy
Add unit tests for privacy budget calculations. Validate noise distribution and privacy guarantees using statistical tests. Ensure all privacy queries meet specified epsilon/delta requirements.
