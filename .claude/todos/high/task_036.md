## Task: Integrate Predictive Hooks with pre_tool_guard.py (Static, Secure)
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: [34], [35]

### Description
Refactor pre_tool_guard.py to use the Predictive Hooks Engine and static mappings, preserving security and performance while removing dynamic loading paths.

### Implementation Details
Replace any dynamic loading logic with deterministic, statically configured decisions. Add feature flags (HOOKS_PREDICTIVE, SMART_STATIC_LOADING) for controlled rollout. Maintain all existing security validations and input sanitization. Ensure integration overhead remains <50ms and that decisions are fully auditable. Aim for 30-40% token reduction via predictive hook optimization.

### Test Strategy
Integration tests to measure hook execution time and ensure security validations are preserved. Regression tests across existing workflows. Verify that no dynamic loader code paths are invoked. Validate fallback to baseline static logic when flags are disabled.
