## Task: Migrate Neo4j Driver to Async API
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: DONE
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: None

### Description
Replace synchronous Neo4j driver usage with the async driver to ensure non-blocking database operations.

### Implementation Details
Update src/chatx/storage/graph.py to use neo4j.AsyncGraphDatabase.driver instead of GraphDatabase.driver. Refactor all affected functions to async def and ensure all Neo4j operations are awaited. Use Python 3.9+ for best async driver support. Example:

```python
from neo4j import AsyncGraphDatabase
async def get_data():
    async with AsyncGraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=auth) as driver:
        async with driver.session() as session:
            result = await session.run(query)
            ...
```
Review all usages of the driver to ensure no blocking calls remain. Remove any synchronous context managers or blocking patterns.

### Test Strategy
Write unit and integration tests to verify all database operations are non-blocking and functionally correct. Use asyncio event loop monitoring tools to confirm no blocking calls. Run performance benchmarks to compare async vs. previous sync implementation.
