## Task: Establish Comprehensive Testing Frameworks (Tracks 1 & 2 + Smart Static)
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: [32], [36], [38]

### Description
Set up unit, integration, performance, and security testing tailored to predictive hooks, command consolidation, and smart static loading.

### Implementation Details
Use pytest (v8.x) for unit/integration tests and coverage.py for code coverage. Implement load/latency testing for hooks with locust (v2.x). Security testing via bandit (v1.7+). Automate test runs in CI/CD. Add benchmark gates asserting impact targets: >=30% token reduction (Track 1), >=25% duplication reduction (Track 2), and >=10% configuration optimization (Smart Static). Include determinism tests and concurrency safety checks. Remove or replace any tests assuming dynamic server pools.

### Test Strategy
Run full test suite, validate coverage thresholds, and review security and performance reports. Enforce benchmark gates for impact targets. Perform load and regression tests across feature flag combinations to guarantee deterministic behavior and stability.
