## Task: Maintain and Validate Code Coverage and Performance Benchmarks
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: [13], [14], [15]

### Description
Ensure code coverage remains at 90%+ for all modified modules and validate async throughput improvements.

### Implementation Details
Update and expand test suites for all affected modules. Use pytest-cov (>=4.1) for coverage reporting. Set up CI pipeline to enforce coverage threshold. Implement async performance benchmarks using pytest-asyncio and asynctest. Compare throughput and latency before and after changes.

### Test Strategy
Automate coverage and performance reporting in CI. Block merges if coverage drops below 90%. Document benchmark results and validate against success criteria.
