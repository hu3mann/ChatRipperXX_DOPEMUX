## Task: Establish Project Foundation & Repository (Two-Track + Smart Static Loading)
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: None

### Description
Initialize the project repository, set up Python environment, and configure CI/CD for the Two-Track Evolutionary Integration and Smart Static Loading approach (no dynamic MCP loading).

### Implementation Details
Use Python 3.11+ with Poetry for dependency management. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Include .claude/settings.json and scripts/mcp/mcpctl.py as integration points for static mapping and hook evaluation. Enforce code style with Black and flake8. Scaffold Track 1 (Smart Hooks Evolution, tasks 32-34, 3 weeks) and Track 2 (Progressive Command Consolidation, tasks 35-39, 4 weeks), and prepare for Smart Static Loading alternative (tasks 40-43, 1 week). Add feature flags: SMART_STATIC_LOADING, TRACK1_HOOKS, TRACK2_COMMANDS. Prioritize deterministic builds and reproducible environments.

### Test Strategy
Validate repository structure and initial CI pipeline, including linting and formatting checks. Set up a CI test matrix for feature flags (TRACK1_HOOKS and TRACK2_COMMANDS toggled on/off). Verify deterministic builds via hash/snapshot checks. Establish baseline benchmark harness for hook latency and token usage to compare against future improvements.
