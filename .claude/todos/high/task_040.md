## Task: Smart Static Loading Optimization and Safe Fallbacks
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: [36]

### Description
Optimize static, startup-time configuration with deterministic selection and safe, reversible fallbacks to known-good versions. Dynamic loading is abandoned; all behavior is fixed at initialization and remains static thereafter.

### Implementation Details
Implement deterministic, startup-only configuration management focused on static selection and pruning. Replace prior dynamic-loading concepts with static configuration optimization. Provide environment toggles read only at process start: SMART_STATIC_CONFIG (replaces SMART_STATIC_LOADING), PREDICTIVE_SELECTION (replaces HOOKS_PREDICTIVE), and CONSOLIDATION. Snapshot and version static configurations, storing a manifest with version/hash and metadata, and enable restoration from version control to a last known-good snapshot. Enforce a pure, reproducible selection function that maps inputs (env toggles, feature flags, platform constraints) to a single immutable configuration. Perform startup-time validation (schema, referential integrity, completeness) and, on validation failure, atomically fall back to the previous known-good snapshot before proceeding. No background hooks, on-the-fly changes, or runtime mutation. Target 10–15% configuration optimization via refined static selection and pruning of unused mappings/resources. Maintain zero architectural complexity and deterministic behavior throughout.

### Test Strategy
Unit tests: verify the selection function is deterministic (same inputs yield identical configuration content and hash across runs). Integration tests: confirm environment toggles are applied at startup only and result in the expected static configuration; verify the configuration is immutable/read-only after startup. Fallback tests: simulate invalid or degraded configuration at startup and assert automatic restoration to the last known-good snapshot prior to continuing initialization; verify the applied configuration matches the expected snapshot manifest. Optimization tests: confirm pruning reduces unused mappings/resources and meets the 10–15% optimization target (size/count deltas). Regression tests: ensure no post-startup mutation attempts can alter the configuration and that configuration artifacts are consistent and reproducible.
