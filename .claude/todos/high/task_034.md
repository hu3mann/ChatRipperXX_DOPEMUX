## Task: Develop Predictive Hooks Engine for Token Reduction (Track 1)
- **ID**: 20250906-185622
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Context**: taskmaster_migration
- **Dependencies**: [33]

### Description
Create a lightweight, deterministic hooks engine that precomputes context and minimizes tokens without any dynamic server lifecycle management.

### Implementation Details
Eliminate dynamic loading; focus on precomputation and fast, static decisions. Precompile regex patterns and static maps; add small LRU caches for recent decisions. Use asyncio only where strictly necessary for non-blocking editor/file I/O. Expose tunables via ConfigManager. Target 30-40% token reduction while keeping per-hook overhead under 50ms. Emit structured diagnostics for metrics collection and auditability. Ensure deterministic behavior to avoid race conditions and unpredictable delays.

### Test Strategy
Unit test hook decision correctness, cold vs warm-path latency, and token reduction versus baseline. Determinism tests ensuring identical inputs yield identical outputs. Stress tests for concurrency safety without race conditions. Benchmark to validate target latency and 30-40% token reduction objectives.
