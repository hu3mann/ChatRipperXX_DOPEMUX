# Documentation Home

Start at `index.md` for the structured documentation portal with links to architecture, design specs, how‑tos, development, operations, and reference.

- Main entry: see [index.md](./index.md)
- Quick orientation: see [overview.md](./overview.md)

Notes
- The `.claude/` directory contains automation- and tool-specific materials; they remain in place and are referenced from the Reference → Commands page.
- All documents are UTF‑8 and organized under `docs/` by topic: design, development, how‑to, operations, policy, reference, and research.
