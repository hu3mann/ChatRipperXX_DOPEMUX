# Security & Vulnerability Reporting

We take security seriously. This project processes sensitive personal data, and all contributors must prioritize user privacy and safety.

Report a Vulnerability
- Please create a private report by emailing the maintainer’s GitHub‑noreply address listed in `git log` or open a GitHub Security Advisory if available for this repository.
- Do not open public issues for unpatched vulnerabilities.

Scope
- Leaks of personal data (PII), unsafe default configurations, missing redactions, or bypasses of local‑only processing.
- Denial‑of‑service or logic bugs that materially degrade privacy protections.

Response
- We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours and work toward a fix or mitigation promptly.
- Coordinated disclosure is appreciated; we will credit reporters in release notes unless anonymity is requested.
