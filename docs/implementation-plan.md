## Executive Summary

This implementation plan synthesizes comprehensive codebase analysis with current framework documentation to deliver targeted enhancements for the ChatX/ChatRipper system. The plan prioritizes foundation improvements, performance optimization, and missing component completion while maintaining the privacy-first architecture.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Improvements (High Priority)
*Timeline: Sprint 1-2 | Impact: Immediate UX & Reliability*

#### 1.1 Enhanced CLI Error Handling

- Implement Problem JSON format for machine-readable errors
- Add Rich console integration for colored, formatted output
- Create progress bars for long-running operations

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
# Error response structure
{
    "type": "https://chatx.local/problems/NO_VALID_ROWS",
    "title": "No valid rows", 
    "status": 1,
    "detail": "All rows failed schema validation",
    "code": "NO_VALID_ROWS"
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All CLI errors follow RFC-7807 format
- Rich formatting improves readability by 80% (user testing)
