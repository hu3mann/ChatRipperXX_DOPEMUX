# ChatX/ChatRipper Comprehensive Refactor & SOTA Upgrade PRD

## Project Overview
Upgrade ChatX/ChatRipper to SOTA embedding models (Stella-1.5B-v5, Cohere v3.0) while addressing technical debt and architectural improvements identified in code review.

## Objectives
1. **Primary**: Implement SOTA embedding model support for enhanced multi-vector system
2. **Secondary**: Address code quality issues from comprehensive review
3. **Tertiary**: Clean repository structure and improve documentation

## Key Requirements

### Phase 1: Foundation Cleanup & Architecture Fixes
- Fix Graph Storage Connection Management - migrate to AsyncDriver with proper connection lifecycle
- Fix Psychology Embedding Model Loading - implement lazy loading with async initialization  
- Standardize Error Handling - implement RFC-7807 problem+json format across modules
- Complete repository structure cleanup (filename fixes, documentation organization)

### Phase 2: SOTA Embedding Integration
- Research and validate Stella-1.5B-v5 integration requirements
- Research and validate Cohere v3.0 integration requirements
- Design embedding provider abstraction for multiple SOTA models
- Implement provider selection and fallback mechanisms
- Create benchmarking suite for embedding quality comparison

### Phase 3: Multi-Vector System Enhancement  
- Enhance psychology embedding provider with SOTA models
- Implement efficient embedding caching and storage
- Add embedding similarity and retrieval optimizations
- Create embedding model hot-swapping capabilities

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- Comprehensive integration testing with existing pipeline
- Performance benchmarking against current implementation
- Memory usage optimization for large models
- Documentation and deployment guides

## Technical Constraints
- Privacy-first: Local processing with optional cloud via --allow-cloud flag
- Quality: â‰¥90% test coverage, lint+mypy clean, RFC-7807 error handling
- Performance: Maintain or improve current processing speeds
- Memory: Efficient model loading and caching strategies

## Success Criteria
- SOTA embedding models fully integrated and tested
- All technical debt items from code review addressed
- Performance benchmarks show improvement or parity
- Clean repository structure with organized documentation
- Comprehensive test coverage maintained

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Backward compatibility with existing embeddings
- Graceful degradation if SOTA models unavailable
- Clear migration path from current implementation
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Dependencies
- Sentence Transformers library updates
- Neo4j AsyncDriver migration
- Cohere API integration (if cloud mode enabled)
- Hardware optimization for local Stella-1.5B-v5

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain fallback to existing embedding providers
- Incremental rollout with feature flags
- Comprehensive testing before deprecating old providers
- Performance monitoring during transition
